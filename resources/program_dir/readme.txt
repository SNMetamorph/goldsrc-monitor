GoldSrc Monitor - small and simple utility for mapping/scripting or researching 
games based on GoldSrc engine (such as CS 1.6, HL, HL:OF, HL:BS, and other HL-mods).


Using: 
    1. Unpack all from archive to any folder
    2. Start game 
    3. Run gsm-loader.exe
    4. Follow instuctions from tool console
	

Also, you can use (but not necessary) a configuration file gsm_config.cfg located in archive.
Just place gsm_config.cfg file in Half-Life/valve directory for using config as common for all games.
Or place config in Half-Life/GAMEDIR (for example Half-Life/cstrike) directory for using config for particular game.
NOTE: If config not specified for particular game, then will be used common config from Half-Life/valve folder.

Default gsm_config.cfg has script for switching display modes using keys Page Up & Page Down
If you don't want to use it, just comment all script lines in gsm_config.cfg
